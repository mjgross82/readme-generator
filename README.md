  Navigate to the desired directory on your local drive using your computer's terminal app. Enter the command "git clone https://github.com/mjgross82/readme-generator.git" on the command line to clone the repository to your local drive. Enter the command "npm i" on the command line to install the required Node.js modules.  
  ## Usage  
  Enter the command "node index.js" on the command line to run the app. The app will ask you a series of questions through your terminal and use built-in validation methods to confirm that no answers are left blank and that a valid Github username and email address format were provided. Once all questions have been answered, the app will format and write your answers to a README.md in the readme-generator directory.
